# üè° Predicting Your Household Carbon Footprint üå≥

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to estimate the monthly carbon footprint of individual households based on lifestyle factors, household characteristics, energy consumption patterns, and sustainability practices. The goal is to provide personalized insights into carbon emissions, helping households identify ways to reduce their environmental impact.

## Problem Statement
Households are significant contributors to global carbon emissions, yet many people do not have a clear understanding of how their daily habits affect the environment. Traditional carbon footprint calculators often miss critical lifestyle factors. By using Machine Learning on household data, we can estimate carbon footprints more accurately, empowering individuals to make informed, climate-friendly choices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Dive into Prediction!
Ready to explore your potential carbon footprint? Here's how to get started:

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost scikit-learn
```
Clone the Repository: (Optional, but recommended for contributing) If you want to contribute or keep a local copy, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tushargupta1111/HackerEarth-Machine-Learning-challenge-Earth-Day
cd HackerEarth-Machine-Learning-challenge-Earth-Day
```
Explore the Data:

* `train.csv`: This is your training ground! It contains various features about households and their corresponding carbon footprint (the target we want to predict).
* `test.csv`: The challenge! This file holds the features for which we will predict the carbon footprint.
* `submission.csv`: This is where our predictions for the test.csv will be saved in the required format.
* `Carbon_Footprint.ipynb`: The heart of the project! This Jupyter Notebook contains the step-by-step code for data wrangling, model training, prediction generation, and insightful visualizations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Code: From Data to Prediction
Follow these steps within the `Carbon_Footprint.ipynb` to run the project:

1.  **Load the Data:** The notebook begins by loading `train.csv` and `test.csv` using the pandas library.

2.  **Preprocess the Data:** This crucial stage prepares the data for the machine learning model:
    * **Handling Missing Values:** We employ intelligent techniques to fill in incomplete data, ensuring the model has complete information to learn from.
    * **Data Type Conversion:** Ensuring all data is in the correct format (e.g., numerical) for analysis and modeling.
    * **Categorical Feature Engineering:** Transforming text-based features (like diet or transportation mode) into a numerical format that the XGBoost model can understand. This allows the model to learn relationships from these important aspects of household behavior.

3.  **Train the Prediction Model:**
    * **Feature and Target Separation:** We separate the independent variables (features) from the dependent variable (carbon footprint) in the training data.
    * **Hyperparameter Optimization:** To achieve the best possible performance, we use `RandomizedSearchCV` to automatically find the optimal settings (hyperparameters) for our XGBoost model.
    * **Model Training:** Finally, the XGBoost model, known for its power and efficiency, is trained using the best hyperparameters found.

4.  **Generate Predictions:** The trained model is then used to predict the carbon footprint for the households in the `test.csv` file.

5.  **Save Predictions:** The predicted carbon footprints are saved into the `submission.csv` file in the required format.

6.  **Evaluate Performance:** The notebook includes an evaluation of the model's performance on the training data using the R-squared value. This metric tells us the proportion of the variance in the carbon footprint that our model can predict from the given features. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit.

## üìä Visualizing the Impact
The `Carbon_Footprint.ipynb` also contains code to visualize the distribution of carbon footprints using histograms, providing a visual understanding of the range and frequency of emissions in the dataset.

## üì§ Understanding the Output
The `submission.csv` file will contain two columns: a household identifier (likely an ID from the `test.csv`) and the corresponding predicted monthly carbon footprint for that household.

## ü§ù Contributing: Help Us Improve!
